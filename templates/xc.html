                <p class="leading-relaxed text-base mb-4">The advent of the World Wide Web and the rapid adoption of social media platforms (such as Facebook and Twitter) paved the way for information dissemination that has never been witnessed in the human history before. Besides other use cases, news outlets benefitted from the widespread use of social media platforms by providing updated news in near real time to its subscribers. The news media evolved from newspapers, tabloids, and magazines to a digital form such as online news platforms, blogs, social media feeds, and other digital media formats [1]. It became easier for consumers to acquire the latest news at their fingertips. Facebook referrals account for 70% of traffic to news websites [2]. These social media platforms in their current state are extremely powerful and useful for their ability to allow users to discuss and share ideas and debate over issues such as democracy, education, and health. However, such platforms are also used with a negative perspective by certain entities commonly for monetary gain [3, 4] and in other cases for creating biased opinions, manipulating mindsets, and spreading satire or absurdity.

                <h2 class="text-lg sm:text-xl text-gray-900 font-medium title-font mb-2">Proposed Framework</h2>
                <p class="leading-relaxed text-base mb-4">In our proposed framework, as illustrated in Figure 1, we are expanding on the current literature by introducing ensemble techniques with various linguistic feature sets to classify news articles from multiple domains as true or fake. The ensemble techniques along with Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC) feature set used in this research are the novelty of our proposed approach.There are numerous reputed websites that post legitimate news contents, and a few other websites such as PolitiFact and Snopes which are used for fact checking. In addition, there are open repositories which are maintained by researchers [11] to keep an up-to-date list of currently available datasets and hyperlinks to potential fact checking sites that may help in countering false news spread. However, we selected three datasets for our experiments which contain news from multiple domains (such as politics, entertainment, technology, and sports) and contain a mix of both truthful and fake articles. The datasets are available online and are extracted from the World Wide Web. The first dataset is ISOT Fake News Dataset [23]; the second and third datasets are publicly available at Kaggle </p>

                <h2 class="text-lg sm:text-xl text-gray-900 font-medium title-font mb-2">Algorithm</h2>
                <p class="leading-relaxed text-base mb-4">Logistic Regression
                  As we are classifying text on the basis of a wide feature set, with a binary output (true/false or true article/fake article), a logistic regression (LR) model is used, since it provides the intuitive equation to classify problems into binary or multiple classes [27]. We performed hyperparameters tuning to get the best result for all individual datasets, while multiple parameters are tested before acquiring the maximum accuracies from LR model. Mathematically, the logistic regression hypothesis function can be defined as follows 
                  
                  Logistic regression uses a sigmoid function to transform the output to a probability value; the objective is to minimize the cost function to achieve an optimal probability. The cost function is calculated as shown inSupport Vector Machine
                  Support vector machine (SVM) is another model for binary classification problem and is available in various kernels functions [28]. The objective of an SVM model is to estimate a hyperplane The function above uses a linear kernel. Kernels are usually used to fit data points that cannot be easily separable or data points that are multidimensional. </p>

                <h2 class="text-lg sm:text-xl text-gray-900 font-medium title-font mb-2">Conclusion</h2>
                <p class="leading-relaxed text-base mb-4">The task of classifying news manually requires in-depth knowledge of the domain and expertise to identify anomalies in the text. In this research, we discussed the problem of classifying fake news articles using machine learning models and ensemble techniques. The data we used in our work is collected from the World Wide Web and contains news articles from various domains to cover most of the news rather than specifically classifying political news. The primary aim of the research is to identify patterns in text that differentiate fake articles from true news. We extracted different textual features from the articles using an LIWC tool and used the feature set as an input to the models. The learning models were trained and parameter-tuned to obtain optimal accuracy. Some models have achieved comparatively higher accuracy than others. We used multiple performance metrics to compare the results for each algorithm. The ensemble learners have shown an overall better score on all performance metrics as compared to the individual learners.

                  Fake news detection has many open issues that require attention of researchers. </p>
